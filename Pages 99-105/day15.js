}
//enclosed by curly brackets {}
//doesn't end with a semicolon

//Conditionals
//1. If -> expression is evaluated, if value is truthy, statement executed
//         expression is evaluated, if value is falsy, statement not executed
//parenthesis required around expression
//If/else 
//evaluates an expression and executes one of the two pieces of code

//2. Else/If -> if there are multiple pieces of code to choose from
//else/if is used to evaluate the truthy one

//3. Switch -> when all branches depend on the value of the same expression, more efficent than multiple else/if
//uses caselable
//break
//default

//4.Loops
//while loops -> repeated execution if value of expression is truthy
//while(true) - infinite loop
